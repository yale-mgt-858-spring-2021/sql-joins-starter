A `purchase_items` row must have a `state` that is one of three values:
Pending, Delivered, or Returned. We'd like to know for each U.S. state
(like VA, CA, or CT) how many purchase_items are in each state. (The term 
"state" in this database has two different meanings: a U.S. state and an item status! ðŸ™ƒ)
Please `COUNT` the number of orders that we have in each item state for each
U.S. state ðŸ˜‰. Order the results ascending by U.S. state first and
`purchase_items` state second. 

Please name your columns as `state`, `item_state`, and `count`, respectively.

You might find the following SQL constructs useful in your answer: `JOIN`,
`ON`, `COUNT`, `GROUP`.

Your results should look something like this:
```
â”‚ state â”‚ item_state â”‚ count â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¤
â”‚ CO    â”‚ Delivered  â”‚   112 â”‚
â”‚ CO    â”‚ Pending    â”‚    10 â”‚
â”‚ CO    â”‚ Returned   â”‚    11 â”‚
â”‚ FL    â”‚ Delivered  â”‚   152 â”‚
â”‚ FL    â”‚ Pending    â”‚    10 â”‚
â”‚ FL    â”‚ Returned   â”‚    11 â”‚
â”‚ GA    â”‚ Delivered  â”‚   129 â”‚
â”‚ GA    â”‚ Pending    â”‚     8 â”‚
â”‚ GA    â”‚ Returned   â”‚     3 â”‚
â”‚ IL    â”‚ Delivered  â”‚   104 â”‚
