A `purchase_items` row must have a `state` that is one of three values:
Pending, Delivered, or Returned. We'd like to know for each U.S. state
(like VA, CA, or CT) how many purchase_items are in each state. (The term 
"state" in this database has two different meanings: a U.S. state and an item status! ðŸ™ƒ)
Please `COUNT` the number of orders that we have in each item state for each
U.S. state ðŸ˜‰. Order the results ascending by U.S. state first and
`purchase_items` state second. 

Please name your columns as `state`, `item_state`, and `count`, respectively.

You might find the following SQL constructs useful in your answer: `JOIN`,
`ON`, `COUNT`, `GROUP`.

Your results should look something like this:
```
â”‚ state â”‚ item_state â”‚ count â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¤
â”‚ CO    â”‚ Delivered  â”‚    89 â”‚
â”‚ CO    â”‚ Pending    â”‚     4 â”‚
â”‚ CO    â”‚ Returned   â”‚     5 â”‚
â”‚ FL    â”‚ Delivered  â”‚    98 â”‚
â”‚ FL    â”‚ Pending    â”‚     5 â”‚
â”‚ FL    â”‚ Returned   â”‚     7 â”‚
â”‚ GA    â”‚ Delivered  â”‚    86 â”‚
â”‚ GA    â”‚ Pending    â”‚     4 â”‚
â”‚ GA    â”‚ Returned   â”‚     6 â”‚
â”‚ IL    â”‚ Delivered  â”‚    81 â”‚
â”‚ IL    â”‚ Pending    â”‚     3 â”‚
