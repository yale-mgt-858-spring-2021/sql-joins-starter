Please, find out how many units of each product have been sold.  Get the
title of each of them and the total number of sales.  Note: you should
bring data from two tables: `gift_store.products` and
`gift_store.purchase_items`.  You might find the following SQL constructs
useful in your answer: `JOIN`, `ON`, `SUM`, `GROUP BY 1`.
  
Your results should look something like this:
```
│     product      │ units_sold │
├──────────────────┼────────────┤
│ 42" LCD TV       │        118 │
│ Baby Book        │        127 │
│ Classical CD     │         93 │
│ Desktop Computer │        135 │
│ Holiday CD       │        139 │
│ Coloring Book    │        115 │
