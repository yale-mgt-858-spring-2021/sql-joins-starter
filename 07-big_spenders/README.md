Please make a list of customer emails for customers that have spent more than $10,000 in the gift store 
(i.e., greater than $10,000). To do this, youâ€™ll need to join *three* tables in the gift_store schema 
(now that you are familiar with this database, we'll let you determine what tables are relevant ðŸ˜Ž).
Please sort in descending order of net spend.

For this query, remember that revenue (or spend) equals price * quantity ðŸ’°.

You might find the following SQL constructs useful in your answer: `JOIN`, `ON`, `SUM`, `HAVING`

Please name your columns `email` and `net_spend`, respectively.

Your results should look something like this:
```
â”‚           email            â”‚ net_spend â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¤
