Ok, we want to reactivate some of our customers that have gone dormant.
For this analysis, I want you to imagine that the date is '2020-01-01',
that is the first of Jan, 2021 (before the dark time...that's roughly
when these purchase data end).  Please find all customers who have made
more than 20 purchases from our store but haven't purchased anything in
the last month (one month before 2020-01-01). 

Your results should look something like this:
```
│           email            │ num_purchases │    lastest_purchase    │
