We would like to determine what items are the top ten best selling at the gift store. 

Please write a query that returns a productâ€™s id, title, and the total quantity of 
that product sold (again, we will leave it to you to determine the relevant tables ðŸ¤ª)

Please name your columns `product_id`, `product_title`, and `sum`, respectively. 

You might find the following SQL constructs useful in your answer: `JOIN`, `SUM`, `LIMIT`


Your results should look something like this:
```
â”‚ product_id â”‚  product_title   â”‚ sum â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¤
