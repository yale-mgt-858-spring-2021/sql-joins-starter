Now, instead of getting the maximum and minimum prices per zip code, please show the total amount spent by zip code. 
Please, order the results by zip code in descending order.
Your results should look something like this (these might not be correct results)
```
   zipcode |   sum   
  ---------+---------
     99867 |  127.98
     99845 |   14.99
     99825 |  998.00
