In this assignment you will practice SQL queries that use `JOIN`
to join multiple tables.
Please
check the "secrets" section of your class profile to
find the authentication parameters you will need to 
connect to the database. You can connect to the database
using any PostgreSQL client you wish. When you are satisfied
with you answer to each question, you will need to paste
it in, below. The questions are as follows.
Unless otherwise specified
you can use the default sort for the table.
