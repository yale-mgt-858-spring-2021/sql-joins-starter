In this assignment you will practice SQL queries that use `JOIN`
to join multiple tables. You connect to the class database just
like you did in the previous assignment. 
When you're ready to start, [accept this GitHub Classroom invite](https://classroom.github.com/a/3vPt80gS)
and paste your repo URL below. Then you can push to GitHub up 
until the deadline. Don't be shy about asking for help in Slack.
