Select the total number of products that were sold in each of the purchases
Note: you should bring data from two tables : products and purchase_items.
You might find the following SQL constructs useful in your answer: `JOIN`, `ON`, `GROUP BY 1`, `ORDER BY`, `ASC`.

Your results should look something like this (these might not be correct results)
``` 
  id  | sum 
-----+-----
    1 |   2
    2 |   2
    3 |   6
    4 |   3
```
